# FloatingWindows
FloatingWindows extension for DM. **Requires Xposed!**

This is based on XFHW3 (a fork of the now unmantained XHaloFloatingWindow). Credits to @shooash for creating XHFW3, and to @zst123 for creating the original XHaloFloatingWindow!

## What id "DM"?
To be continued... ;)

## How does this differ from XHFW3?
* This fork only works from Android 4.4 Kitkat (SDK 19) onwards. Support for Jellybean 4.1 - 4.3 is not planned (Sorry!).
* Theoretical support for Android 7.0 Nougat (when Xposed supports it).
* Material Design for everyone!
* Removed the aging tab strip, replacing them with more intuitive tabs.
* Removed features not necesary for what I'm doing.

#### Forks and pull-requests welcome!
