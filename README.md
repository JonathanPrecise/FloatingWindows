**This project, and all plans to work on it, have been temporarily paused. It will, however, resume in an undetetermined future date**
---

FloatingWindows extension. **Requires Xposed and a rooted smartphone/tablet**

This is based on [XFHW3](https://github.com/shooash/XHFW3) (a fork of the now unmantained [XHaloFloatingWindow](https://github.com/zst123/XHaloFloatingWindow)). Credits to @shooash for creating XHFW3, and to @zst123 for creating the original XHaloFloatingWindow!

## Disclaimer
FloatingWindows will probably not work for SAMSUNG devices with TouchWiz, and it *may* cause conflicts with some LG tablets. And as any Xposed module, this may cause damages including, but not limited to: bricking your phone, causing bootloops.

We take **no responsibility** if anything undesired happens to your phone after installing FloatingWindows.


## How does this differ from XHFW3?
FloatingWindows:
* only works from Android ~~4.1 Jellybean~~ 5.0 Lollipop onwards (tested up to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow).
  * Note: FloatingWindows currently installs correctly on Android Kitkat, but doesn't function properly. This is a bug, which will be fixed in a future release.
* theoretically supports Android 7.0 Nougat and Android 8.0 Oreo (although this has not been tested).
* has been revamped and refreshened, with another updated design in the works.
* Removed the aging tab strip, replacing them with more intuitive tabs.
* Removed features not necesary for what I'm doing.
