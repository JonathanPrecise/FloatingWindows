FloatingWindows extension for DM. **Requires Xposed and a rooted smartphone/tablet**

This is based on [XFHW3](https://github.com/shooash/XHFW3) (a fork of the now unmantained [XHaloFloatingWindow](https://github.com/zst123/XHaloFloatingWindow)). Credits to @shooash for creating XHFW3, and to @zst123 for creating the original XHaloFloatingWindow!

## Disclaimer
This will probably not work for SAMSUNG devices with TouchWiz, and it *may* cause conflicts with some LG tablets. And as any Xposed module, this may brick your phone, cause bootloops, make you go mad, or cause a catastrophe.

Jokes aside, be careful with this. We take no responsibility at all if anything weird or undesired happens.

## What is "DM"?
To be continued... ;)

## How does this differ from XHFW3?
* This fork only works from Android 4.4 Kitkat (SDK 19) onwards. Support for Jellybean 4.1 - 4.3 is not planned (Sorry!).
* Theoretical support for Android 7.0 Nougat (when Xposed supports it).
* Material Design for everyone!
* Removed the aging tab strip, replacing them with more intuitive tabs.
* Removed features not necesary for what I'm doing.

## Pull-requests
Thank you for your interest in this project! However, since it hasn't been finished yet (it's a WIP), try to not make any pull-request unless you deem it absolutely necessary (security issues, fatal crashes, etc.). We will accept for now those types of pull-requests. Once a substantial amount of work has been done from our part, we will remove the WIP status and remove this restriction. No hard feelings!

## Forks
Completely welcome! **However**, they are not *recommended*, as this is still in the WIP phase. Breaking changes are almost guaranteed to occur.
